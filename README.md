# STAT-427/627 Statistical Machine Learning

This repository contains coursework and notes for **STAT-427/627: Statistical Machine Learning**, a graduate-level course at American University. The course is based on the second edition of *An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R* by James, Witten, Hastie, and Tibshirani.

## üìò Course Description

This course explores key methods in statistical machine learning for analyzing and modeling data. Topics include:

- Linear Regression
- Classification Methods
- Cross-Validation
- Model Selection and Regularization
- Tree-Based Methods
- Support Vector Machines
- Unsupervised Learning
- Deep Learning and Neural Networks

I applied statistical learning methods using R and a variety of packages in practical machine learning and data science workflows.

## üß† Lecture Notes

Lecture notes were prepared by Prof. Richard Ressler and are available as an HTML file in this repository. The notes build on the ISLR textbook and integrate content from previous lectures by Prof. Michael Baron.
